 <p>The first day of my journey!
    I can't believe I finally managed to put everything
    aside and go on a trip. </p>

 <h2>14 July, 2012</h2>
<p>
 I saw a couple of Burma Shave style signs
 on the side of the road. One moment and eternity </p>

 <blockquote>
    If you don't notice passing cars,
     they can kill you.
    One moment and eternity.
 </blockquote>
  
 <p>I definitely didn't want to be hit by a car.</p>
